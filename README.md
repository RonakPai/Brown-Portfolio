# Brown-Portfolio
Over the last two summers, I have interned at two companies, Edmodo Education and Milestone Internet Marketing. This gives an example of the work I did over the past two summers at these companies. 

# Description of what I did
At Edmodo, the project had the broad goal of giving back to the community. There are two different projects I worked on: the first used machine learning to detect litter on the streets of India to report to the authorities and clean up the streets. The second uses machine learning and speech-to-text algorithms to give feedback on speaking style. In particular, the program gives feedback on the clarity and the emotions that the speaker is speaking with. The program is intended to help people who might not have the resources to afford an English tutor or need to prepare for a presentation without any help to improve their speaking ability. 

At Milestone, the goal of the project was to automate internal tasks. The program goes through the google results for a client's name and scrapes pages to see if there is a backlink to the client's website in order to assist with search optimization for the client.
